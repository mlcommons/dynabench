## Setting up EC2 instance<a name="ec2"></a>

__Note__: The cost of this service depends on the instance you choose and you can see the pricing list [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/).

### Creating EC2 instance <a name="create_ec2"></a>

Create an EC2 instance, add all traffic for port 80 and 22, then access it.

Steps:

1. Click on Launch instances.

    ![launch instances](img/clic%20launch%20instances.png)

2.  Select an instance type (according to your choice the cost should change, you can see the pricing list [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)).

    ![instance_type](img/instance_type.png)

3.  Create a new key to connect to your instance.

    ![create_key](img/create_key.png)

4.  Name your key and press *Create key pair*, it will generate a .pem file that you have to store in a folder you can reach.

    ![name_key](img/name_key.png)

5. Edit the security group to allow traffic from the internet and SSH connection.

    ![creating_sg](img/creating_sg.png)

6. Rename the security group and make sure you have available port 80 and port 22, if you don't, press the *Add security group rule* button and look for both rules.

    ![add_sg_rules](img/add_sg_rules.png)

7. Press the *Launch instance* button on the lower right side.

    ![launch_instance](img/launch_instance.png)

8. Go back to EC2, select your instance and click on *Connect*.

    ![connect instance](img/connect_instance.png)

9. Click on ssh client, open a new terminal on your computer, access the folder where you store your .pem file generated on step 6 and run the *chmod* and then run the *ssh* command.

    ![access to instance](img/access_to_instance.png)

10. If you did everything well, you will end up with the following view on your terminal.

    ![successful connection](img/successful_connection.png)

### Installing git <a name="git"></a>

Install git with the following command.

``` bash
sudo yum install git
```

### Installing docker <a name="docker"></a>

Install and run docker with the following commands.

``` bash
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo service docker start
```

After installing docker, make sure you have permissions to run docker commands by running the following:

``` bash
docker images
```

If you run the previous command and you end up with the following message, run the next command.

``` bash
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/images/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

Command to run:

``` bash
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Installing nginx <a name="nginx"></a>

Install nginx with the following command:

``` bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1
```

#### Open EC2 ports to receive requests <a name="ec2_ports"></a>

Open the nginx.conf file with the following command:

``` bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Replace this file with the following content:

``` none
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

include /usr/share/nginx/modules/*.conf;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
    sendfile            on;
    tcp_nopush          on;
    tcp_nodelay         on;
    keepalive_timeout   65;
    types_hash_max_size 4096;

    include             /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type        application/octet-stream;

    server {
        listen       80;
        listen       [::]:80;
        server_name  <**YOUR_INSTANCE_IP_ADRESS example 44.201.16.144**>;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8001;
        }
}
}
```

Make sure you update the variable __server_name__ located in the __server__ key in the previous text.

Example:

server_name  32.268.128.174;

In order to get your instance IP address, open EC2 in your AWS account and click on your instance, then copy the number on the Public IPv4 address section.

![ip_adress](img/ip_adress.png)

Then restart nginx with the following command:

``` bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

## Starting the app <a name="start_app"></a>

### Download the project <a name="download"></a>

Download repository with the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/dynabench.git
```

### Access the correct folder <a name="folders"></a>

Access to new_builder_evaluation folder that contains the backend of the challenge with the following command:

``` bash
cd dynabench/new_builder_evaluation/
```

### Install requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

Install the requirements by running the following command:

``` bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating .env file <a name="env"></a>

At this point you have stored 10 variables, but you are missing just 3

- *CENTRALIZED_URL* The value for this variable is http://builder.dynabench.org/
- *CPU_UTILIZATION* add 1024 for each core you want to use. If you want to use 4 cores the value of this variable is going to be 4096
- *MEMORY_UTILIZATION* add 1024 for each GB you want to use as ram. If you want to use 16 gb the value of this variable is going to be 16384

Create the .env file by running the following command:

``` bash
sudo nano app/domain/.env
```

Add all the variables that you stored in the previous steps and you will end up with a file like the following:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[get here](#user)
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[get here](#user)
- AWS_REGION=[get here](#region)
- AWS_S3_BUCKET=[get here](#bucket)
- CLUSTER_TASK_EVALUATION=[get here](#cluster)
- SUBNET_1=[get here](#cluster)
- SUBNET_2=[get here](#cluster)
- SECURITY_GROUP=[get here](#cluster)
- EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN=[get here](#execution_role)
- SQS_NEW_BUILDER=[get here](#sqs)
- CENTRALIZED_URL=http://builder.dynabench.org/

### Run the API <a name="run_api"></a>

Run the following command:

``` bash
uvicorn app.app_decentralized:app --port 8001
```

If everything is working well, you can open an internet browser and enter the following url:

- http://your_EC2_ip_adress/docs

It will open the FastAPI swagger that looks like this

![fast_api_swagger](img/fast_api_swagger.png)

Congratulations!!!, your decentralized project has been deployed.
